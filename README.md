Tower Defence Dating Sim

# Defence and Desire
**Slogan:** *Win their hearts, win the war.*

## Overview
**Defence and Desire** is a tower defence game mixed with dating-sim mechanics. You defend your base from waves of enemies while forming relationships with the towers you place on the battlefield. Each tower has its own personality, preferences, and compatibility issues. Stronger relationships unlock stronger abilities, upgrades, and synergies.

The challenge is not only building a strong defence but also managing the emotional landscape of your towers. Some towers will conflict with others, so your romantic decisions directly affect your strategic options.
